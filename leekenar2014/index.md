## MOOCs 

Primary characteristics are open access, low cost, scalable, online

## How I got into teaching the masses

* __Previously__ : Youtube lectures and “flipping” the classroom.
* __7-1-2012__: Brian tells me Hopkins has a deal with Coursera 
* __7-1-2012__: Roger walks by my office and I tell him he’s in
* __7-2-2012__: Roger and I sign up
* __7-5-2012__: Roger and I make our advertising videos
* __7-17-2012__: Official announcement by JHU
* __9/2012__: – Roger’s/Brian’s courses run
* __1/2013__: – Jeff’s course runs

## Rubric (examples)

<center>Rate each question on a scale from 1 = Poor to 10 = Excellent</center>

* __Formatting__
  1. Does the analysis have an introduction, analysis, and conclusions? 
  2. Does the analysis include references for the statistical methods used? 

* __The Question__
  1. Is the type of question specified (exploratory, inferential, predictive, causal)? 
  2. Does the analysis answer the scientific question? 

* __The Data__
  1. Does the analysis include a complete description of how the data was collected? 
  2. Is there a complete description of how the data was accessed/processed? 

---

## Rubric (continued)

* __Exploratory Analysis__
  1. Does the analysis report any missing data or other unusual features? 
  2. Does the analysis include description and justification for data transformations? 

* __Statistical Models__
  1. Are appropriate statistical models applied? 
  2. Are estimates reported with appropriate units and measures of uncertainty? 

* __Conclusions/Reproducibility__
  1. Does the analysis make concrete conclusions?
  2. Does the analysis specify potential problems with the conclusions? 


---

## Some thoughts on peer grading

* Students __hate__ this
* Informal data analysis suggests they are pretty good
  * At finding the best analyses
  * At finding the worst analyses
* Things I learned about rubric
  * Must be incredibly concrete (yes/no)
  * If you use a scale explain the scale (0 = no effort, 1 = created file, 2 = etc.)
  * Stick to your guns during
* I think this is the only way to scale grading for the important parts
  * Statistics is still mostly an art
  * Composition matters __a lot__

## Interesting fallout from doing this

*** =left
- Jeff's class was listed as one of the top 10 most enrolled Coursera classes
  - Roger's class has since eclipsed it in cumulative enrollment (damnit)
- Brian's class featured on the front page of the Washington Post 
- Roger interviewed on Anderson Cooper and NPR

*** =right
- Scott Zeger introduced class *Cased Based Introduction to Statistics*
- Brian introducted *MBBC2*
- Martin Lindquist introduced *Statistical Analysis of fMRI Data*
- John McGready introduced *Statistical Reasoning for Public Health*

## The "genius moves" continue

* __2013__: Roger/Brian/I run our courses again
* __September 2013__: Some genius decides we should do a whole program
* __November 19, 2013__: Daphne Koller visits JHU and we tell her we have a program
* __December-Now__: We create a program
* __April 7th__: First 3 courses launch
* __May 7th__: Next 3
* __June 7th__: Next 3
